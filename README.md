# PasswordManager

# Password Generator (Tkinter)

A simple password generator and basic credential manager built with Tkinter.  
The application generates a random password, displays it in the UI, copies it to the clipboard, and allows saving website credentials to a local file.

This project is intended for learning purposes.

- Random password generation (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Placeholder-like behavior (fields clear on focus)
- Input validation (no empty fields allowed)
- Confirmation dialog before saving data
- Credentials saved to a local `data.txt` file
- Automatically copies generated password to clipboard
- Logo displayed using a canvas (`logo.png`)
- Centered window with focus handling (macOS-friendly)
